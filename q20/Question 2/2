How does the closure ensure that the balance variable is private?

Closures ensure that the balance variable remains private by keeping it inside the lexical scope of the outer function and only 
allowing controlled access through the inner functions. The balance variable cannot be accessed directly from outside because it is 
not returned or exposed globally—it lives only inside the closure environment. When the outer function returns the inner functions, 
those functions retain access to the balance variable even after the outer function has finished executing. 
This way, JavaScript allows reading or modifying the balance only through predefined methods such as deposit or withdraw, preventing accidental or unauthorized changes. 
Thus, closures act like a secure capsule, maintaining data privacy and integrity similar to private properties in object-oriented programming.
